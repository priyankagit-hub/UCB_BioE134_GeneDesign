def hairpin_checker(dna):
    """
    Checks for bad hairpin structures in the DNA sequence by splitting it into 50 bp chunks with
    an overlap of 25 bp, and passing each chunk to hairpin_counter. If any chunk has more than
    1 hairpin, it returns False and the problematic hairpin string. Otherwise, it returns True and None.

    Parameters:
        dna (str): The DNA sequence to analyze.

    Returns:
        tuple: (bool, str or None)
            - True and None if no problematic hairpins are found.
            - False and the problematic hairpin string if more than one hairpin is found in any chunk.
